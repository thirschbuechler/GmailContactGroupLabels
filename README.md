- paste the contents of the GmailContactGroupLabels file into the empty Code.gs window
- replace ContactsGroupName with the contact group of contacts.google.com you want to be labeled in gmail
- replace GmailGroupName with the gmail group of gmail.com (create the label in gmail first!) you want the group to have
- review the code if you want
- save the file via the menu file+save (in your google drive)
- click "run" and authenticate the script to access gmail and your contacts
- make it autorun if you want by creating a trigger, according to http://www.johneday.com/422/time-based-gmail-filters-with-google-apps-script
